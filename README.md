# CSC384
All CSC384 (Artificial Intelligence) assignments for 2018, all of which were given a 100% grade. Working with my partner, we create various agents for the game "Pacman" to survive and beat the level of increasing difficulty which was a main focus of the course. This involved writing algorithms including A* and Alpha-Beta pruning to improve the Minimax search.
